%   Estimate a collection of gradients from input/output pairs.
%
%   Inputs:
%          X: M-by-m array containing the the points at which to estimate
%             the gradients with finite differences
%          fun: function handle which accepts input values and returns
%               scalar simulation evaluations
%          h: (optional) scalar which gives the finite difference step size
%             Default: 1e-6
%
%  Outputs:
%          df: M-by-m matrix containing estimated gradients using finite
%          differences
