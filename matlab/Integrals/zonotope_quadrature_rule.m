%   Quadrature when the dimension of the active subspace is greater than 1 
%   and the simulation parameter space is bounded.
%
%   Inputs:
%          W1: m-by-n array containing the eigenvectors that define a basis
%              of the n-dimensional active subspace
%          N: the number of quadrature nodes in the active variables
%          NX: (optional) the number of samples to use to estimate the
%              quadrature weights
%              Default: 100,000
%
%  Outputs:
%          Yp: quadrature nodes on the active variables
%          Yw: quadrature weights on the active variables
